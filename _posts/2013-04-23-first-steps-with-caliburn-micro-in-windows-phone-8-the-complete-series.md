This post is simply a collector of all the blog posts I wrote about using Caliburn Micro, a very powerfull Model-View-ViewModel framework, in Windows Phone 8. The posts are listed in chronological order, so it will be easier for you to follow the logic path of the posts: from the basic concepts (whatâ€™s Caliburn, conventions, etc.) to the most complex stuff (tombstoning, collections, messaging).

This list will be published also at the bottom of every post of the series, so that it will be easier for you to jump from a post to another.

Here we go!
