One of the requisites to pass the certification for a Windows 8 application is to provide a support page, where the user can find all the information needed to get in touch with the developer. This requirement is inherited directly from the Windows Phone world, even if, some time ago, this feature has turned from required to optional. Usually, in a Windows Phone application, developers provided a separate page: users are able to reach it using a button in the main view or in the application bar.

In Windows 8 applications we have a new way to manage this requirement, without having to create a separate page just to display some contact information: the Settings panel. This panel is displayed in the charm bar (that appears when the user moves the mouse at the right top corner of the screen) and it‚Äôs the ideal place where to insert all the stuff related to the settings of the application. It‚Äôs also a good position where to place the support page of our application.

Let‚Äôs see how to do this in a XAML / C# application.

### 

### Create the support page

To create the support page it‚Äôs enough to add a simple standard page to the project, where we‚Äôre going to place all the information to contact the developer: a website‚Äôs url, a mail address, a Twitter account, etc.

There‚Äôs nothing special to tell about this info page: it should be a standard XAML page, that uses the **Basic Page** template. While adding content to this page we have just to keep in mind that just a small portion of it (more precisely, the left side) will be displayed in the settings panel, so be careful aligning the controls un the correct way.

### 

### Attach the page to the settings panel

Now that we have a page to display, we have to ‚Äúattach‚Äù it to the Settings panel, in order to allow users to access to it. To achieve this results we‚Äôre going to use a third party library available on Nuget and <a href="https://github.com/timheuer/Callisto" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, called **Callisto**. This toolkit features a lot of useful controls for developing Windows 8 applications: one of them is the **SettingsFlyout** control, that exactly it our needs.

Which is the purpose of this control? Usually the settings panel is based on a primitive WinRT control called **Popup**: this control is based on a ‚Äúlight dismiss‚Äù logic and many Windows 8 controls are based on it. Basically, using this logic means that something is displayed on the screen and the user can dismiss it by simply tapping in an area outside of the control. The settings panel is a good example of this behavior: if you invoke it by using the charm bar and then you tap somewhere else in the screen, the settings panel is hided.

Let‚Äôs see how to use it: the first thing is to install Callisto in our project, just search for Callisto in Nuget and install the package that will be displayed in the results page.

The next step is to register in the application the event that is raised every time the user tap on the settings icon in the charm bar: when this event is raised, we‚Äôre going to set our command that will attach the setting page to the panel.

The event is called **CommandsRequested** and it‚Äôs available in the **SettingsPane** object; to use it, first, we have to get settings panel for the current view by calling the **GetForCurrentView()** method, like in the following example:

<pre class="brush: csharp;">SettingsPane.GetForCurrentView().CommandsRequested += MainPage_CommandsRequested;</pre>

Now we have to manage the event handler (that in this example is called **MainPage_CommandsRequested**), where we are going to register a **SettingsCommand,** that is invoked when the user presses the settings icon in the charm bar.

The settings command accepts three important parameters:

  * the command id, that should be unique;
  * the label that is displayed in the Settings panel to access to our info page;
  * the handler that is invoked, where we are going to use the **SettingsFlyout** class that is available in the Callisto toolkit.

Let‚Äôs see the code first:

<pre class="brush: csharp;">void MainPage_CommandsRequested(SettingsPane sender, SettingsPaneCommandsRequestedEventArgs args)
{
    SettingsCommand command = new SettingsCommand("Support", "Support", (x) =&gt;
    {
        SettingsFlyout settings = new SettingsFlyout();
        settings.Background = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.White);
        settings.HeaderBrush = new SolidColorBrush(Color.FromArgb(255, 99, 4, 4));
        settings.Content = new InfoPage();
        settings.HeaderText =
            "Informazioni";
        settings.IsOpen = true;
    });

    args.Request.ApplicationCommands.Add(command);
}</pre>

&nbsp;

The first step is to create an instance of the **SettingsCommand**: in this example **Support** is both the command id and the label that is displayed in the Settings pane. As I said earlier, the third parameter is the command that is effectively invoked when the command is issued: in this handler we‚Äôre going to create an instance of the **SettingsFlyout** control, that will ‚Äúencapsulate‚Äù the info page we‚Äôve created earlier and adapt it to be inserted in the settings panel.

The **SettingsFlyout** control has many properties that allow us to customize it: we can set the background color, the brush and the text of the header and so on; the most important one is the **Content** property, that defines the content of the panel. In this case, we‚Äôre simply going to create a new instance of the support page we‚Äôve created in the beginning of this post (in my example, it‚Äôs called **InfoPage**)**.**

The last two important things are to set the **IsOpen** property to **true** and then to add the command **ApplicationCommands** collection, that contains all the commands that are available in the Settings panel. We can access to this collection using the **Request** object, that is one of the properties of the **SettingsPaneCommandRequestedEventArgs** parameter of the handler.

And.. we‚Äôre done! We can simply register the **CommandsRequested** handler when the application starts: the result is that, when the user will tap on the Settings icon in the charm bar, he will see an item called **Support**: clicking on it will display the support page with the light dismiss logic described before.
