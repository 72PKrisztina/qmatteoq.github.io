I’m happy to announce that, last week, Syncfusion, a popular company among developers for their great suites of controls, has released my new book titled **Windows Phone 8 Development Succinctly**. It’s a digital free e-book and, in 243 pages, it covers most of the important concepts to develop a Windows Phone application, from the basic ones (like the XAML, the application lifecycle, etc.) to the most advanced ones (like background tasks, geolocalization and speech APIs).

Here is a quick recap of the chapters:

  1. Introduction 
      * The User Interface: Basic XAML Concepts 
          * Core Concepts 
              * Data Access: Storage 
                  * Data Access: Network 
                      * Integrating with the Hardware 
                          * Integrating with the Operating System 
                              * Multimedia Applications 
                                  * Live Apps: Tiles, Notifications, and Multitasking 
                                      * Distributing the Application: Localization, the Windows Phone Store, and In-App Purchases</ol> 
                                    The book is distributed by Syncfusion for free, you just have to register and then you’ll be able to download it both in PDF and Kindle format. I hope that the book can be a great resource both for new developers, that want to start learning the basic Windows Phone concepts, and for already skilled developers, that can use the book as a reference for all the APIs and features offered by the platform.
