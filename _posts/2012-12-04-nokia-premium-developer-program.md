Nokia has recently announced a new initiative for Windows Phone developer that is really interesting. At the same price of a standard Windows Phone account for developers (which is 99 $) you will have access to the following benefits:

  * A token to subscribe for one year to the Windows Phone Dev Center, so that you can publish your apps and unlock up to 3 devices. The token can be used to register for the first time or to renew an existing subscription.
  * A license for the [Windows Phone suite by Telerik](http://www.telerik.com/products/windows-phone.aspx), that offers many useful and powerful controls.
  * A one year subscription to Buddy.com, that offers many cloud services that can be integrated into a Windows Phone application to manage push notifications, authentication or real time messaging. With these services developer will just have to configure and connect to these services (using standard protocols), without bothering about developing and maintaining them. [Buddy.com](http://www.buddy.com/)Â offers different subscriptions plans: the one included in the Nokia offer allows you to make up to 1 million of API calls per month.
  * 2 tickets to ask support to Nokia if you have problems while developing your application.

The total value of these benefits is 1500 $: if youâ€™re thinking about subscribing to the Store or you have an existing subscription that you want to renew, you donâ€™t want to miss this chance!

Youâ€™ll find all the information and the link to purchase the offer [in this page](http://www.developer.nokia.com/Developer_Programs/Premium_program.xhtml) of the Nokia Developer portal.
