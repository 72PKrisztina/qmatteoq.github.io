In the previous post weâ€™ve created and configured a background task for our Windows 8 application: weâ€™ve created a separate project for the task and weâ€™ve configured the manifest file. Now itâ€™s time to write the code in the client to register the background task, so that the application can take advantage of it. Weâ€™re going to register the background task weâ€™ve created in the previous post: a timer based task that simply display a toast notification.

Here is the code that we insert in the **MainPage.xaml.cs** file, which is the code behind of the first page that is loaded when the application starts.

<pre class="brush: csharp;">private async void RegisterBackgroundTask()
{
    try
    {
        BackgroundAccessStatus status = await BackgroundExecutionManager.RequestAccessAsync();
        if (status == BackgroundAccessStatus.AllowedWithAlwaysOnRealTimeConnectivity || status == BackgroundAccessStatus.AllowedMayUseActiveRealTimeConnectivity)
        {
            bool isRegistered = BackgroundTaskRegistration.AllTasks.Any(x =&gt; x.Value.Name == "Notification task");
            if (!isRegistered)
            {
                BackgroundTaskBuilder builder = new BackgroundTaskBuilder
                {
                    Name = "Notification task",
                    TaskEntryPoint =
                        "BackgroundTask.NotificationTask.NotificationTask"
                };
                builder.SetTrigger(new TimeTrigger(60, false));
                builder.AddCondition(new SystemCondition(SystemConditionType.InternetAvailable));
                BackgroundTaskRegistration task = builder.Register();
            }
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Debug.WriteLine("The access has already been granted");
    }
}</pre>

The first thing we do is ask the user the permission to run the background task by calling the metod **RequestAccesAsync** of the **BackgroundExecutionManager** class. When this method is called, a dialog box is displayed and the user can choose if the wants to enable or not the task: the choice is returned by the method embedded into a **BackgroundAccessStatus** enumerator. You will immediately notice that the whole code is embedded into a **try / catch** statement: this is required due to a bug in WinRT APIs, that returns an exception in case the user has already accepted to run the background task.

In case the user has confirmed to run the task we search if itâ€™s already registered in the operating system. Unlike in Windows Phone, in fact, itâ€™s possible to register the same task multiple times: in Windows Phone, instead,Â youâ€™ll get an exception. To accomplish this task we access to the collection of all the registered tasks (**BackgroundTasksRegistration.AllTasks**) and we look for a task which name is **Notification task:** later youâ€™ll see that this is the name we set for our task.

If the task isnâ€™t registered yet, we go on and register it: we create a new **BackgroundTaskBuilder** object and we set two properties: **Name**, which is the identifer of the task (itâ€™s the one weâ€™ve used before to check if itâ€™s already registered or not), and **TaskEntryPoint**, which is the same value we set in the **Entry point** parameter of the manifest: itâ€™s the full name of the class which hosts the background task, plus the namespace. In our example, the entry point is **BackgroundTask.NotificationTask.NotificationTask.**

Itâ€™s now time to define the type of background task weâ€™re going to register: we do this by using the **SetTrigger** method on the **BackgroundTaskBuilder** object. Since in this example weâ€™re going to create a timer task, we set a new **TimeTrigger** and we choose to run it every 60 minutes. Background tasks in Windows 8 support also **conditions**, which are a great way to make sure that a task is execute only when one or more criteria are satisfied: in this example, since weâ€™re going to simulate a background task that periodically checks for some news, we add a **SystemCondition** of type **InternetAvailable.** This way, we can avoid to check in the background task if there is an active Internet connection because, if itâ€™s not the case, the task wonâ€™t be executed at all.

In the end we register the task by calling the **Register** method. Last but not the least, we need to add a reference of the background taskâ€™s project to the client: letâ€™s right click on the client project, choose **Add reference** and, by using the **Solutions** tab, double click on the backgroundâ€™s task project.

### Itâ€™s time to debug!

Weâ€™ve created a background task but how can we debug it? Obviously, Visual Studio 2012 offers a smarter way than simply waiting for the condition to be satisfied (in our example, an Internet connection is available and the 60 minutes time trigger is reached). First we have to register the task when the application is launched: in this example weâ€™re going to call the **RegisteredBackgroundTask** method weâ€™ve just defined when the **MainPage** is initalized, so we call it in the constructor.

The first time the application is launched, youâ€™ll see the dialog that will ask you the permission to run in background: confirm it and, once the application is started, go back in Visual Studio. Now right click with your mouse on one of the empty spaces near the toolbars and choose to display the **Debug location** toolbar. Near the name of the process youâ€™ll find a dropdown menu, with some precious options that will allow you to simulate the various states of the application lifecycle (**Suspend**, **Resume** or **Suspend and shutdown**): in our case, since weâ€™ve registered a background task, you will see another option with the name of our background task, that is **Notification task.**

Click on it andâ€¦ voilÃ , your background task will be executed: if you set a breakpoint on the **Run** method of your background taskâ€™s project, youâ€™ll see that is triggered and youâ€™ll be able to debug it as you would normally do with another application.

And if it doesnâ€™t work? Here are some common things to check in case you have problems:

  * Make sure that the background taskâ€™s project type is **Windows Runtime Component.**
  * The client should have a reference of the backgroundâ€™s task project: check the **References** tree of your clientâ€™s project.
  * Check the applicationâ€™s settings (using the settingâ€™s icon in the charm bar) and make sure that both notifications and background tasks are enabled.
  * Make sure that the entry point is correct,Â both in the manifest and in the code. It should be the name of the class with, as prefix, the full namespace.
