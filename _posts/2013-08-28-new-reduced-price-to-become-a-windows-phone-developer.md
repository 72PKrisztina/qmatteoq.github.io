Very quick post to highlight a very important change for Windows Phone developers: as you know, development tools are completely free but, to publish applications on the Store, you have to pay an annual 99$ fee, which is required to cover all the costs needed to run the Store (certification process, reports, etc.). During the summer, Microsoft has launched a temporary promotion, that reduced the price to 19$. Now the promotion has ended but Microsoft, <a href="https://twitter.com/toddbrix/status/372444926099070976" target="_blank">with a tweet</a> posted by Windows Phone program manager Todd Brix, has announced that **the 19$ reduction will be permanent**. So, from now on, you’ll just have to pay 19$ to purchase a new subscription or to renew an already existing one. You don’t have anymore excuses to publish your Windows Phone apps! <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="https://i1.wp.com/wp.qmatteoq.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wlEmoticon-smile1.png?w=640" data-recalc-dims="1" />
