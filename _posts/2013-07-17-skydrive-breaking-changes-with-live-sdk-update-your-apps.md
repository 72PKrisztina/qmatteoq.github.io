**Update:Â** as the developer Graham Haley has reported me on Twitter, Microsoft has fixed the server sode issue and [reported it in the official MSDN forum.](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/live/en-US/52ab9b0f-71f5-437e-be0b-48115a9ba0a9/skydrive-update-related-to-sdk-5052-and-wlupload)Â This means that your application should work fine now even if you&#8217;re using a Live SDK version prior to 5.4.

Unlike the other posts I usually write, this post will be very quick  <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" alt="Smile" src="https://i2.wp.com/wp.qmatteoq.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wlEmoticon-smile.png?w=640" data-recalc-dims="1" />Microsoft has introduced a breaking change in the SkyDrive APIs offered by the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/live/ff621310.aspx" target="_blank">Live SDK</a> (which is the library, available on NuGet, that can be used to interact with Live services within a Windows Phone or Windows 8 application). If your application is using SkyDrive integration (like my app <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=a476ab62-44b4-4cca-9763-e7e064a1cc26" target="_blank">Movies Tracker</a>), for example, to provide backup and restore features, you may notice that the downloaded file is corrupted, so the restore procedure will always fail.

The solution is simple: update your project to use the latest Live SDK release, which is the **5.4**. Previous versions wonâ€™t work any more. The breaking change seems to be just server side: you donâ€™t have to modify anything in your code. If youâ€™re using NuGet, the operation is really simple: right click on your project, choose **Manage NuGet packages** and switch to the **Updates** tab. After a while, NuGet will find a new Live SDK version: just click on **Update** and youâ€™re all set. Obviously, if your application is already using the 5.4 release you wonâ€™t have to do anything.

And if your application doesnâ€™t support SkyDrive integration but youâ€™re interested in implementing it, thereâ€™s a <a href="http://wp.qmatteoq.com/backup-and-restore-on-skydrive-in-windows-phone/" target="_blank">blog post I wrote</a> a while ago about this topic.

Happy development!
